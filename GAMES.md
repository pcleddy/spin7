# Games Base Spec

This document defines the default lifecycle, board behavior, and join/leave rules for games in the overall game board. It is intended to be a reusable base for future games, not just Flux.

## How To Use This Spec

Use this document as the shared base spec for any game that needs:

- a board-first landing screen
- a list of current games
- create/join/rejoin behavior
- leave and return behavior
- lightweight player identity and device handoff

This spec is meant to work alongside a separate game-specific rules document.

Recommended split:

- `GAMES.md` defines the shared system behavior
- a game-specific spec defines the actual game rules

`GAMES.md` should usually own:

- board and lobby behavior
- game states
- join/leave/rejoin flows
- identity and rejoin model
- cross-device movement
- default API/data-shape expectations

The game-specific rules doc should usually own:

- round rules
- scoring
- win conditions
- turn structure
- special actions
- any game-specific permissions or exceptions

If the game-specific rules doc conflicts with this spec, the game-specific rules should explicitly call out the exception rather than silently overriding the base behavior.

## Overview

The system supports a list of games. Each game is a joinable activity with:

- a creator
- zero or more currently active players
- zero or more inactive former players who may be allowed to rejoin while unfinished
- a visible state on the game board
- a lifecycle that ends in a finished state

The default product pattern is:

1. Users land on a game board first.
2. The board shows current games, or an empty state if there are none.
3. Users can create a game from that board.
4. Users can join or rejoin existing unfinished games directly from that board.

## Core Rules

1. There is a visible list of games.
2. The list is the default opening screen.
3. The board should still render when there are no games, using an explicit empty state.
4. Players can join unfinished games.
5. Players can leave unfinished games at any time.
6. Players who leave an unfinished game can rejoin that same game.
7. Games become `finished` when either:
   - the game completes normally, or
   - all players leave
8. The current state of every game must be visible on the board.
9. Solo games and multiplayer games are both valid.

## Default Board UX

The board should include:

- a `Create Game` action
- a manual `Join By Code` action
- a list of current games
- a clear empty state when there are no games

Each board row or card should show at least:

- game identifier or title
- creator
- state
- player count
- round progress or equivalent progress
- a `Join` or `Rejoin` action when allowed

The board should live-refresh while open. Polling is acceptable as a default implementation.

## Suggested Board States

At minimum, each game should expose one clear board-level state:

- `waiting`
- `active`
- `finished`

Optional finer-grained states:

- `in_round`
- `between_rounds`
- `abandoned`

The important requirement is that the game board always communicates current state clearly.

## Joining, Leaving, And Rejoining

Each game should track:

- the creator
- all players who have ever joined
- which players are currently active

Rules:

- Players may join an unfinished game.
- Players may leave at any time.
- A player who leaves an unfinished game may later rejoin it.
- Rejoin should restore that player’s existing slot when possible, rather than creating a duplicate participant.
- If all players leave, the game should be marked `finished`.

## Identity And Rejoin UX

Default UX behavior:

- If the system already knows the user’s name, joining from the board should be one click.
- If the user just left a game, that game’s board action should become `Rejoin`.
- Clicking `Rejoin` should attempt to rejoin directly, without routing the user through a form.
- If the board knows a likely username from local memory or recent session state, it may use that to join directly.
- Only fall back to a join form when the system does not know who the player is.

Default identity model:

- display name should be treated as presentation, not as the sole source of identity
- each player should have a stable internal `player_id`
- each player should have a current session token for the active device
- each player should have a short rejoin credential for recovery or device transfer

Recommended default rejoin mechanism:

- `player_id` for stable identity
- `session_token` for the current active session
- `rejoin_code` for cross-device recovery or reconnection

Default remembered values:

- last known username
- last unfinished game the player left
- last known rejoin credential when appropriate

## Move To Another Device

Games should support a low-friction handoff flow from one device to another.

Recommended default UX:

- include a `Move to another device` action while in a lobby or active game
- show the player:
  - game ID
  - player name
  - short rejoin code
- allow the new device to reconnect using those values
- keep the field order consistent between the transfer UI and the reconnect UI

Recommended transfer behavior:

- the new-device rejoin should preserve the same player identity
- the current active session token should be replaced or rotated
- the player should not appear twice in the same game

This is the preferred default for casual session-based games because it supports:

- player uniqueness
- low-friction recovery
- browser-to-phone or laptop-to-phone handoff
- stronger identity than display-name matching alone

Traditional username/password login is not the recommended default for casual board games unless the product is account-based more broadly.

Recommended reconnect form order:

1. game ID
2. player name
3. rejoin code

The reconnect form should mirror the transfer screen as closely as possible to reduce copy mistakes during device handoff.

## Active Vs Inactive Players

Games should distinguish between:

- active players
- inactive players who previously joined

Board counts and in-game participant displays should generally use active players.

Inactive players should:

- not block round resolution
- not appear as current participants unless explicitly labeled
- be eligible for rejoin while the game is unfinished

## Creator Authority

The creator is the default authority for creator-only controls.

Creator-only actions may include:

- starting the game
- advancing rounds
- final completion actions

Non-creator players may:

- join unfinished games
- leave at any time
- rejoin unfinished games they were already part of
- participate in gameplay

Non-creator players may not perform creator-only control actions unless a specific game explicitly changes that rule.

## Completion Rules

A game becomes `finished` when:

- the final round or final game condition is completed, or
- every player has left

Once finished:

- the board should reflect the finished state
- direct joining and rejoining should stop unless the product defines a restart or clone flow
- the game should no longer accept progression actions

## Recommended API Shape

At minimum, the system should support:

- list games
- create game
- join game
- rejoin game
- leave game
- get game state

Recommended board list response fields:

- `game_id`
- `creator`
- `state`
- `active_players`
- `max_players`
- round or progress summary
- `can_join`

Recommended game-level player fields:

- stable player identity
- active/inactive status
- creator marker or creator identity
- short rejoin credential or equivalent recovery mechanism

## Minimal Data Model

A minimal game record could include:

- `game_id`
- `title`
- `creator_id`
- `state`
- `mode`
  - `solo`
  - `multiplayer`
- `round_index`
- `round_count`
- `player_ids`
- `active_player_ids`
- `finished_at`

A minimal player record could include:

- `player_id`
- `display_name`
- `session_token`
- `rejoin_code`
- `active`
- `joined_at`
- `left_at`

## Frontend Behavior Defaults

Default frontend behavior should be:

- show the board on first load
- auto-refresh the board while the user remains on it
- stop board polling once the user enters a game or lobby
- resume board polling when the user returns home
- if the user leaves a game, return them to the board immediately
- reset the viewport to the top when returning to the board

## Notes

- “All players leave” should be treated as a terminal completion rule by default, not a temporary empty room.
- Rejoining is allowed only while the game is still unfinished.
- Direct board join/rejoin is the preferred default experience.
- The join form should be a fallback, not the primary path, when the system already knows the player identity.
- Cross-device transfer should prefer a short rejoin code over a traditional password for casual session-based games.
- Solo games should follow the same lifecycle rules, with the creator also being the only participant.
